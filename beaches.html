    <h1>Beaches</h1>

     <p> The backgroud picture is of a beach in Bermuda. The sand is really pink
       and my mother took us to the beach almost every day. As far as I know it
       is the only pink sand in the world. I would like to go back and see it again. </p>

      <p> Portugal, Greece and Aruba: three very beautiful places that I have visited.
        Each offers it's own beauty, it's own tranquility. I have sunned on these beaches,
        I have swam in these waters. I have partaken in the peace.</p>
