     <p> This website contains pictures of places where I have been. Some I have
       lived in, others I have visited. The images are not in any order, but
       they represent the journey. Some of the pictures are mine and others are borrowed.</p>

      <img src= "carnaby.jpg" width= "550px" height= "400px">
      <p> The top picture was once my grandfather's farm, it now belongs to an uncle.
        We go there for family get togethers or just a relaxing weekend. The
          next picture is a sign for Carnaby Street in London. It is a side street off of
          Oxford Circus and at the time that I lived there, it was a hippie type place
          to go to for music, posters, clothes, etc. I think it would be fun to go visit.

<!-- putting the pictures in the middle of the tet cause the pictures to be in
different places on the page. I likt it. -->

        <p>The scene from the mountain Wank, is over looking the town
          Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Bavaria, Germany. It was a short walk from where
          we lived for many years. I, too, stood where the photographer stood and
          looked out on the town. The mountain to the left is where my children learned
          ski, twenty plus years after me.

        <img src= "geyser.jpg" width= "550px" height= "550px">
        <p> I lived in Iceland as a child and was able to see and experience
          many wonderful things there. It was a warm, sunny, summer day as I stood in front of a
          geyser just like the one pictured. The water was so warm. It was as
          amazing experience.</p>
        <img src= "rudesheim.jpg" width= "600px" height= "500px">
        <p> Along the Rhine River in Germany are many vineyards. Some of the towns,
          and even the mountains look as if they just drop into the river. The
          town in this picture is near whre we lived for a few years, just a
          twenty minute drive down the mountain.</p>
